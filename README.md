# WiFi Tree Server Quote Bot

My friends and I have a Discord server called the WiFi Tree, and we like to record quotes of ourselves in our server's text channel. I built this bot to allow the server's members to display quotes at any time on the server's text channel. Users can use the bot to display a quote on the text channel, or can add a quote to the quote database through the text channel.

Currently the quote database is kept in a standard text file for easy editing (the text file is not pushed to GitHub at the moment to maintain the privacy of the server's members. The server is run through Replit, an online IDE capable of running the Flask server. To keep the server running (for free Replit users, servers close after an hour of inactivity), a site called UptimeRobot.com is used to ping the server and keep it active.
